🔸 How Housing Affordability Has Evolved Post-COVID 🔸

Housing affordability has always been a challenge, but the COVID-19 pandemic reshaped the landscape dramatically. Using Python, I analyzed the income needed for homeownership in the top 20 metro areas across the U.S. from March 2020 to now.

💠 What is Housing Affordability? It’s the annual income required to buy a home while managing other financial responsibilities. It’s a key metric to measure accessibility to homeownership.

🔹 Top 5 Metro Areas Requiring the Most Income (March 2020): ▪️ San Jose, CA: $400,000+ ▪️ San Francisco, CA: $380,000+ ▪️ Santa Cruz, CA: $350,000+ ▪️ Napa, CA: $320,000+ ▪️ Los Angeles, CA: $300,000+

💡 The Shift to January 2024: Fast forward to now, and affordability has shifted significantly: ▪️ San Jose, CA still leads, with income requirements climbing even higher. ▪️ San Francisco, CA has maintained its position, reflecting California’s continued housing pressures. ▪️ New areas, like Urban Honolulu, HI, have joined the ranks of the most expensive markets, highlighting how affordability challenges have spread beyond traditional hotspots.

🔻 Takeaway: The affordability crisis has only deepened, with surging demand, low inventory, and rising home prices driving income requirements even higher in the most sought-after metro areas.

📌 The Big Picture: This bar chart race shows how income requirements evolved over time, revealing: ▪️ A widening gap in affordability between metro areas. ▪️ The persistence of high housing costs in California, even as other regions face rising pressures. ▪️ A lasting impact of the pandemic on housing markets across the U.S.
